<h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University.
    My research interests include robotics, dynamics, and controls with a specific focus on soft robots.
    Currently, I am exploring physics-based and data-driven modeling and control methods for soft robots in an effort to make such systems more capable and reliable.
  </p><p>
    I am originally from Farmington Hills, Michigan and received a B.S. in Engineering Sciences from Harvard University in 2013.
    After graduating, I worked as a math teacher at the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy in Detroit, then earned a PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan in 2020.
