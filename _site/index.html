<h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.
    My research interests include robotics, dynamics, and controls with a specific focus on soft robots.
    <!-- Currently, I am exploring physics-based and data-driven modeling and control methods for soft robots in an effort to make such systems more capable and reliable. -->
  </p><p>
    I am originally from Farmington Hills, Michigan and received a B.S. in Engineering Sciences from Harvard University in 2013.
    I worked as a math teacher at the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy in Detroit from 2013-2015,
    earned a PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan in 2020,
    and was a postdoc at Harvard University from 2020-2023.
