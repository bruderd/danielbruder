<h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I am a mechanical engineering graduate student at the University of Michigan.
    My research interests include robotics, dynamics, and controls with a specific focus on soft robots.
    Currently, I am exploring data-driven methods for building models of soft robots
    that are amenable to model-based control design techniques.
  </p><p>
    I am originally from Farmington Hills, Michigan and received a B.S. in Engineering Sciences from Harvard University in 2013.
    After graduating, I worked as a math teacher at the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy in Detroit before starting my graduate studies at Michigan in 2015.
